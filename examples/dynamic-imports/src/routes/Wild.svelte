<h2>Wildcard</h2>

<p>Anything in the URL after <code>/wild/</code> is shown below as message. That's found in the <code>params.wild</code> prop.</p>

<p>Your message is: {params.wild}</p>

<p>Note that this route was artificially delayed for 5 seconds to let us see the <code>Loading</code> component even when the network is fast (such as testing on localhost).</p>
